# ESP07_USBTool
3-in-1 board for ESP-07/12

USB powered with FTDI for programming and testing.  
Leave the FTDI and supporting components off for standalone USB 5V powered or 3.5-6V using pads on bottom rear.  
Use as serial+3V3 breakout with 0.1" pads for header on top rear of board.  

First prototype.  Pogo pins weren't measured.  Outer 4 pinholes are for hold downs.   
The new one is smaller, has a reset botton, space for deepSleep and run 0805 pads, or run jumper on JP2, and uses a Microchip LDO.
